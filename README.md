# Unsolver 2019 - Team Sourdough (1.8)

## Challange

**Food waste challange:** *Create a technology-based solution to put an end to food waste in the home*

## Team 
**Team name:** *Sourdough*

**Team members:**
* Angela Rosenberg
* Steinar Sturlaugsson	
* Usman Khan
* Mattias Sjölinder

The team name **_Sourdough_** refers to that bread is the number one most wasted food!

>*Over 240 million slices of bread are chucked away every year. Bread freezes really well, particularly for toast, so make sure you pop in the freezer if you're not going to use it. Stale bread can be turned into croutons, breadcrumbs, eggy bread or even bread & butter pudding.* <sup>1</sup>


## Background 
*More than 820 million (1 in 9) people worldwide are still going hungry, according to a UN report.<sup>2</sup>
United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates the world produces enough food waste — about 1.4 billion tons — to feed as many as 2 billion people each year. That’s roughly one-third of the global food supply.<sup>3</sup>
Fruits and vegetables, plus roots and tubers have the highest wastage rates of any food.<sup>4</sup>
If wasted food were a country, it would be the third largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the U.S. and China.<sup>5</sup>*

**No one wants to throw away food but we anyway end up throwing away tons of food each year. One reason is that you forget what you have in your refrigirator and food cabinets, and perhaps lack of a way of organising what you actually have stored. We can help you catalogize and remind you about what food you have at home! Also, help you come up with new ideas of how to use your groceries and leftovers.**
